In contrast, the selected sam- ples in active crowdsourcing learning are annotated by different nonreliable workers, whose annotations might be incorrect. Traditional AL focuses on samples, labels, costs, and sample–label pairs separately or considers at most two at the time [13], [18]–[20], whereas AMCC should jointly account for the workers (specialty and commonality), costs, samples, and labels. The latter aims at selecting useful but cost-saving sample–label–worker triplets for the query. Existing active crowdsourcing learning approaches [18], [19], [21], [22] cannot be directly adapted for multilabel crowd consensus problems, and they either ignore label correlations, the specialty of workers, or their costs.  |
