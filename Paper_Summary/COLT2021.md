| 2021 |             [Exponential savings in agnostic active learning through abstention](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v134/puchkin21a.html)             | Puchkin and Zhivotovskiy |    COLT     |  -   |  Agnostic Active Learning through Abstention    |       |       |   We show that in pool-based active classification without assumptions on the underlying distribution, if the learner is given the power to abstain from some predictions by paying the price marginally smaller than the average loss 1/2 of a random guess, exponential savings in the number of label requests are possible whenever they are possible in the corresponding realizable problem.    |
| 2021 |                  [Bounded Memory Active Learning through Enriched Queries](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v134/hopkins21a.html)                   |      Hopkins et al.      |    COLT     |  -   |  Bounded Memory Active Learning    |  `stream-based`     |       |   we study what families of classifiers can be learned in bounded memory. To this end, we introduce a novel streaming-variant of enriched-query active learning along with a natural combinatorial strategy called lossless sample compression that is sufficient for learning not only with bounded memory, but in a query-optimal and computationally efficient manner as well.    |
| 2021 | [Improved Algorithms for Efficient Active Learning Halfspaces with Massart and Tsybakov Noise](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v134/zhang21a.html) |       Zhang and Li       |    COLT     |  -   |   `Theory`   |       |       |    We give a computationally-efficient PAC active learning algorithm for d-dimensional homogeneous halfspaces that can tolerate Massart noise (Massart and Ne ́de ́lec, 2006) and Tsybakov noise   |
