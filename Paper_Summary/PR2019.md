(2) This is also the first work to implement the MQCAL method by introducing weighted rank aggregation approaches, and the proposed framework may inspire future AL. (3) We present a mechanism that allows for a dynamic and self-adaptive tradeoff between any number and kind of involved SQC in a unified  system by introducing the BVSB strategy. (4) We summarize basic rules for the use of our RMQCAL. The potentially best combination of involved SQC and rank aggregation approaches is also found from experimental comparative results. (5) Several comparative experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed RMQCAL method in many public data sets  | `binary classification problems through the UCI Repository` |
