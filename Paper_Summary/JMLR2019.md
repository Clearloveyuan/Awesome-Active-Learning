| 2019 |                              [Active Learning for Cost-Sensitive Classification](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume20/17-681/17-681.pdf)                               | Krishnamurthy et al.  |    JMLR     |                         -                         |  Cost-Sensitive Classification    |  `Uncertainty`, `MLP`, `None`, `Tra`, `Hard`     |    ImageNet 20, Imagenet 40, RCV1-v2, POS, NER, NER-wiki  |   COAL assumes access to a set of regression functions, and, when processing an example x, it uses the functions with good past performance to compute the range of possible costs that each label might take. Naturally, COAL only queries labels with large cost range, akin to uncertainty-based approaches in active regres- sion (Castro et al., 2005), but furthermore, it only queries labels that could possibly have the smallest cost, avoiding the uncertain, but surely suboptimal labels. The key algorith- mic innovation is an efficient way to compute the cost range realized by good regressors.    |

| 2017 |               [Asymptotic Analysis of Objectives Based on Fisher Information in Active Learning](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-104/15-104.pdf)               |    Sourati et al.     |    JMLR     |                         -                         |   `Thory`   |  `Fisher Information`     |       |  we attempt to fill this gap and provide a rigorous framework for analyzing existing FIR-based active learning methods. In particular, we show that FIR can be asymptotically viewed as an upper bound of the expected variance of the log-likelihood ratio. Additionally, our analysis suggests a unifying framework that not only enables us to make theoretical comparisons among the existing querying methods based on FIR, but also allows us to give insight into the development of new active learning approaches based on this objective.     |
