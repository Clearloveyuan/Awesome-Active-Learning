This work identifies the initialization of active learning as a separate and novel research problem, reviews existing methods that can be adapted to be used for this task and, in addition, proposes a new active initialization criterion: the Nearest Neighbor Criterion. Experiments on 16 benchmark datasets verify that the novel method often finds an initialization set with fewer queried samples than other methods do.    |  MNIST, USPS, CIFAR10, UCFsports, GTSRB, Isolet, pendigits, satimage, yeast, segment, vowel, lowres, dermatology, led_display, ecoli, semetion   |
